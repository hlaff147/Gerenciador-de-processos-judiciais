        Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise? I thought not.
        It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth
        Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could
        use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had
        such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he
        cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many
        abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the
        only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of
        course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he
        knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could
        save others from death, but not himself.
